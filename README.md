Tweet Miner
===========
Tweet Miner is a NextJS web application that allows a user to
search for Twitter Tweets using keywords.

Usage
-----
Run
```
npm install
```
to ensure that the node modules are installed. Once that is completed,
run
```
npm start
```
to run the application in production mode. The app is configured
to run on localhost:3000 by default so navigating to that in the browser
should display the index page.
To run tests, run the command
```
npm test
```
